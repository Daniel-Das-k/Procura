# Procura - AI-Powered Learning Platform

Procura is a comprehensive, AI-driven educational platform designed to enhance independent learning for students. The platform leverages cutting-edge technologies like Whisper for transcription, Gemini for AI-powered question generation, Mediapipe for real-time interactive sessions, and more. Procura empowers students to translate and interact with educational content, receive tailored feedback, and engage in virtual classrooms, all while ensuring a seamless, scalable, and secure experience.

## Process

1. **Authorization:**

    - Users are redirected to LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for authorization after initiating connections.
    - Upon successful authentication, access tokens, refresh tokens, and token expiry information are obtained.
    - All tokens and expiry details are securely stored in MongoDB.

2. **Content Generation:**

    - Agents use CrewAI technology, supported by Llama 3 and DuckDuckGo, to generate posts.
    - Tokens are securely stored in MongoDB for authentication.
    - Posts are automated across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

3. **Summarization:**

    - Procura automatically generates announcements and posts for Discord servers.
    - When a YouTube video is uploaded and linked to Discord, it triggers the post creation.
    - The video is converted into a post specifically tailored for the Discord community.

4. **Posting:**

    - Access tokens are used to authenticate and post content to various platforms.
    - The generated content is automatically shared using these tokens.
    - Tokens ensure secure posting to platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

4. **Youtube translation and Q&A:**

    - YouTube audio is processed using youtube-dlp and Whisper to generate transcripts for Q&A.
    - Transcripts are transformed into embeddings and stored in a FAISS vector database for efficient retrieval.
    - FAISS retrieves relevant transcript sections for questions, and a language model (Gemini) generates accurate answers.
